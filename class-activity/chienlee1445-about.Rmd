## About Me

I'm an indoor guy who completely fell in love with scuba diving last summer. I've got an open-water diving licence. And planning to get the advance licence after graduating from UCSB. My friend Ryan need a new laptop.

If you could scuba dive anywhere in the world, where?
I would like to go to the great barrier reef in Australia! I heard it feels like paradise over there.
